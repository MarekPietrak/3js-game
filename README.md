# 3JS Game

A minimal Three.js sandbox set up with Vite. Move around with **WASD** and look with the mouse.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a local URL (typically http://localhost:5173). Open it in your browser to play the game.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

The static site will be generated inside `dist/`, which you can serve with any static file server:

```bash
npm run preview
```
